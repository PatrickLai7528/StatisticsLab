'''
Rock-paper-scissors is a hand game played by two or more people where players choose to sign either rock,
paper or scissors with their hands. For your statistics class project, you want to evaluate whether players
choose between these three options randomly, or if certain options are favoured above others. You ask two
friends to play rock-paper-scissors and count the time each option is played. The following table summaries the data:

Rock	Paper	Scissors
43	    21	    35

Use these data to evaluate whether players choose between these three options randomly,
or if certain options are favored above others. alpha is 0.05.
